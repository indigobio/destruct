# destructure

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wintonpc/destructure.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wintonpc/destructure)

Destructuring assignment is an operation typically found in functional programming languages,
including Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, Prolog, and JavaScript (as of ECMAScript 6).
Think of destructuring assignment as regular expressions for data structures.

Consider the following regexp example:

    v = 'madlibs are fun to do'
    if v =~ /madlibs are (?<adjective>\w+) to (?<verb>\w+)/
      puts $~[:adjective]                            # => fun
      puts $~[:verb]                                 # => do
    end

The `=~` operator performs two tasks simultaneously

1. tells us whether `v` matches the regexp pattern
2. binds names to substrings of `v` (if the match succeeded)

With `destructure`, you can pattern match data structures in Ruby.

regexp:

         something =~ /pattern/

destructure:

        something =~-> {pattern}

# Example usage

### nested arrays
    v = [5,[6,7],8]
    v =~-> { [a,[b,c],d] }
    puts a                                         # => 5
    puts b                                         # => 6
    puts c                                         # => 7
    puts d                                         # => 8

### plus, it tells us if the match succeeded
    v = [1,2]
    puts (v =~-> { [a, b] }).inspect               # => #<OpenStruct a=1, b=2>
    puts (v =~-> { [a, b, c] }).inspect            # => nil

### hashes
    v = { x: 1, y: 2 }
    v =~-> { { x: a, y: b } }
    puts a                                         # => 1
    puts b                                         # => 2

### order doesn't matter. the pattern specifies a subset that must match
    v = { q: 5, r: 9, t: 42, u: 99 }
    v =~-> { { u: a, r: b } }
    puts a                                         # => 99
    puts b                                         # => 9

### bind to the hash key names, for brevity
    v =~-> { Hash[q, r, t, u] }                    # equivalent to: v =~-> { { q: q, r: r, t: t, u: u } }
    puts q.inspect                                 # => 5
    puts r.inspect                                 # => 9
    puts t.inspect                                 # => 42
    puts u.inspect                                 # => 99

### objects

    class Widget
      attr_accessor :flange, :sprocket

      def initialize(flange, sprocket)
        @flange, @sprocket = flange, sprocket
      end
    end

### work similarly to a hash
    v = Widget.new('gibble', 8)
    v =~-> { Object[flange: a, sprocket: b] }
    puts a                                         # => gibble
    puts b                                         # => 8

### bind to the attribute names, for brevity
    v =~-> { Object[flange, sprocket] }
    puts flange                                    # => gibble
    puts sprocket                                  # => 8

### constrain the acceptable type
    match_result = v =~-> { OpenStruct[flange, sprocket] }
    puts match_result.inspect                      # => nil

### pattern attributes must be present, else match fails
    match_result = v =~-> { Object[flange, sprocket, whizz] }
    puts match_result.inspect                      # => nil

### it subsumes native Ruby functionality:

### regexes
    v = [1, 2, 'hello, bob']
    v =~-> { [a, b, /hello, (?<name>\w+)/] }
    puts a                                         # => 1
    puts b                                         # => 2
    puts name                                      # => bob

### splatting
    v = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    v =~-> { [1, 2, ~stuff, 9] }                   # '~' indicates a splat
    puts stuff.inspect                             # => [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

### pattern variables can be pretty much anything that goes on the left hand side of an assignment
    v = [1,4,9]
    v =~-> { [1, @my_var, 9] }
    puts @my_var                                   # => 4

    basket = {}
    v = [1,4,9]
    v =~-> { [1, basket[:thing_i_found], 9] }
    puts basket[:thing_i_found]                    # => 4

    one = OpenStruct.new
    one.two = OpenStruct.new
    v = [17,19,23]
    v =~-> { [17, one.two.three, 23] }
    puts one.two.three                             # => 19

### use '!' to match the value of an expression rather than bind the expression
    y = 3
    puts ([1, 2, 3] =~-> { [1, 2, !y] }).inspect   # => #<OpenStruct>
    puts ([1, 2, 4] =~-> { [1, 2, !y] }).inspect   # => nil
    puts ([1, 2, 4] =~-> { [1, 2, y] }).inspect    # => #<OpenStruct y=4>
    @my_var = 789
    puts (789 =~-> { !@my_var }).inspect           # => #<OpenStruct>
    puts (456 =~-> { !@my_var }).inspect           # => nil
    puts (456 =~-> { @my_var }).inspect            # => #<OpenStruct @my_var=456>

### specify the same variable multiple times in the pattern to require those parts to match
    puts ([1,2,3] =~-> { [x,2,x] }).inspect        # => nil
    puts ([1,2,1] =~-> { [x,2,x] }).inspect        # => #<OpenStruct x=1>

### use wildcards (underscore) when you require a value but otherwise don't care about it
    puts ([1, 2, 'ack!$&@'] =~-> { [1, 2, _] }).inspect # => #<OpenStruct>
    puts ([1, 2, 'ack!$&@'] =~-> { [1, 2, 3] }).inspect # => nil

### you can specify alternative patterns, like in regexes
    puts (:foo =~-> { :foo | :bar }).inspect       # => #<OpenStruct>
    puts (:bar =~-> { :foo | :bar }).inspect       # => #<OpenStruct>
    puts (:baz =~-> { :foo | :bar }).inspect       # => nil

### bind a variable while continuing to match substructure
    v = ['hello', 'starting']
    v =~-> { [ greeting = String, participle = /(?<verb>.*)ing$/ ] }
    puts greeting                                  # => hello
    puts participle                                # => starting
    puts verb                                      # => start

    v = [:not_a_string, 'starting']
    puts (v =~-> { [ greeting = String, participle = /(?<verb>.*)ing$/ ] }).inspect # => nil

# Implementation

The `=~->` "operator" is really the `=~` operator overridden to take a `Proc`, while retaining the
usual `Regexp` matching functionality. By rearranging the spaces, you can see that the "->" part
of the "operator" comes from stabby lambda syntax:

    v =~ ->{ pattern }

If the argument is a `Proc`, `=~` uses the sourcify gem to obtain the body of the Proc as a parse tree.
The parse tree pattern is transformed into a plain ruby object pattern, which is then processed with
a lower level matcher, described later.

### Local variables

Part of the magic of `=~->` is that it seemingly binds local variables during pattern matching,
even locals that haven't appeared or been assigned in the code.

It does this by using the binding_of_caller gem to obtain the Binding of the `=~->` caller, and upon
matching successfully, attempts to set the appropriate local variables in the caller's binding.
Due to limitations of Ruby, it cannot set a local variable that has not already been assigned in
the caller's local scope. To work around this, `=~->` uses `method_missing` to implement private
attributes that mimic local variables. These attributes are parameterized on their caller, so as
to behave like local variables. That is, it prevents a fake local `x` in method `foo` from leaking
into another method `bar` that also accesses `x`.

# Interface variants

Use destructure by including the Destructure module. It provides the method `dbind`.

    require 'destructure'

    class MyClass
      include Destructure

      def foo(thing)
        if dbind(thing) { [1,2,x] }
          puts x
        end
      end
    end

`=~->` is an alias for the `dbind` method. It is provided in 'destructure/magic' and
automatically includes the Destructure module in the calling class.

    require 'destructure/magic'

    class MyClass
      def foo(thing)
        if thing =~-> { [1,2,x] }
          puts x
        end
      end
    end

The `Destructure` module takes a few optional parameters. For example,

    class MyClass
      include Destructure[:bind_locals => false, :matcher_name => :matches, :env_name => :m]

      def foo
        case [1,2,3]
          when matches { [4,5,x] }
            fail
          when matches { [1,2,x] }
            expect(m.x).to eql 3
          else
            fail
        end
      end
    end

* `bind_locals` defaults to `true` and determines whether or not to bind to local variables, including fake locals.
* `matcher_name` specifies the matcher name for the alternative `case/when`-specific syntax demonstrated above.
* `env_name` specifies the name of a method you want to access the environment through.

The purpose of `matcher_name` and `env_name` is to allow you to choose short names that don't conflict
with other methods in your class.

If you set `bind_locals` to `false` and do not specify `env_name`, the only way to access the pattern variable
environment is to save the return value of `=~->` (or `dbind`).

    class MyClass
      def run(v)
        case
          when e = v =~-> { [4,5,x] }
            puts e.x
          when e = v =~-> { [1,2,x] }
            puts e.x
        end
      end
    end
